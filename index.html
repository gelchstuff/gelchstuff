            <h2>March 3, 2025</h2>
            <p>This is the first thing to ever be posted on my website. It's like Twitter
                but only I can post on it. I'm only going to upload to it when I am hammered. 
                Eventually I'll figure out how to put a big picture of Bill Cosby at the top
                of the screen or something I don't know.</p>

            <p> I feel like I am in a really transitional stage of my life, but I also think
                I've thought the same thing every year for the past 7 years. I'm 20 now and I can't win 
            a game of Fortnite for some reason. I haven't won a single game since I turned 20. I only ever play
            cross-eyed drunk so that could have something to do with it</p>

            <p> Getting broken up with is the same feeling for me as when I had no friends as a kid. For some reason I
            mostly hung around retards whenever I went through periods of having no friends. Everybody talks about their friends
            Like they have known them for their whole life, but I've met all of my best friends over the past 4 or so years.
            It's not even like I got bullied, I don't know what it was. Everybody got bullied. A kid would shove you to the ground
            at recess and tell a girl you had a crush on her, then invite you to his birthday party 20 minutes later. I think the worst part 
            of it was I had no safe haven. Nobody at school was on my side, and so was nobody at home. Not like I was abused, I was just 
            the youngest. I remember my parents being so shocked when I would get in trouble for bullying kids, I don't know how they
            didn't realize where this issue may have stemmed from. These are the same people who pumped me with 70mg of Adderall at age 12.</p>

            <p> I got sort of side tracked. But it's like when I was a kid I had nobody to talk to my feelings or really anything about.
            Nobody in my family was my age, the ones who were I didn't see enough. All things considered I'm pretty lucky I didn't turn into some
            incel-twitter-fag. Whenever a relationship ends it feels like nobody is around who gets you anymore. When I get low, which seems to be
            the norm now, I don't have anybody to just rant to it about. I'd call my mom, but then she gets worried I'll off myself. I know I could still
            probably call ex-girlfriend and talk to her, and she'd still probably listen, but I can't put myself through that. How do you remind yourself
            that this person made the decision they don't want you anymore? I'm not still in love with her, I don't think she is with me, but I seethe
            with jealousy at the thought of her with other people. I have no right.</p>

            <p> Hopefully I'll get a new script soon and be able to focus better. I can barely get work done now. I'm basically a functioning alcoholic. 
            I'm having money problems. I never knew of money problems growing up. This is my first time really experiencing this. I feel guilty mentioning
            things related to my families money infront of friends at school, but it's hard to convince yourself that your family has money after growing up
            around what I did. </p>

            <p> I have not had a single stress free moment in probably 3 weeks, since I had my last panic attack. Something really changed in me that night.
            I worry that was more of a psychotic break than it was a panic attack. Time will tell. This is the worst I've felt in a long time. I dont even 
            really want to ski.</p>
