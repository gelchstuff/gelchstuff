            <p>This is the first thing to ever be posted on my website. It's like Twitter
                but only I can post on it. I'm only going to upload to it when I am hammered. 
                Eventually I'll figure out how to put a big picture of Bill Cosby at the top
                of the screen or something I don't know.</p>
