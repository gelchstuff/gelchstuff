<p> Extra Tall Coffin </p>

            <p> Today was a harder day than last. This is my own fault I refuse to take responsibility and get my work done when it is needed.
            I am on the verge of a full blown panic attack and I don't know when it will happen. Feelings of self harm have never been 
            something I have given any breath to, and I wll not now. I will feel better eventually, I know this, I just fear it 
            may be some time. I wonder what percent of days in my life have been good days. I fear that last spring was the best time in my life.
            I was also oblivious to the things going on around me. I fear that without intervention my situation will only worsen. I can barely
            function as a human being as is. I don't know if I am lazy, depressed, or just losing my mind. </p>

            <p> I did lose my mind once, I know how it feels. Feelings of paranoia are returning to my daily thoughts. I refuse to accept any love or 
            kindness that is shown to me and I am not sure why. I still doubt the love anybody has ever had for me. I don't see myself as a likeable
            person. I am offputting and mean. I insult those I care about most and embarrass myself infront of ones who I do not care about. I act
            as if I am a confident person, but I just embarrass myself on purpose to make it seem like I am in control. My logic is you can't say anything
            bad about me if I am being ridiculous on purpose. I don't know if this actually works. People likely just think i am being mean to them and
            think I am better than them.</p>

            <p> I'd be lying if I denied having narcissistic thoughts. I see myself as intellectually and physically superior to most anyone I meet, yet
            these ideas are grounded in nothing. The truth is I am pretty fucking retarded. I'm not good at anything. I've been insulted for my 
            intelligence my entire life. I was always the dumb friend, but I look at myself as lazy. I don't know where the idea I am good looking 
            comes from either. Yes I have slept with a number of good looking women, but I don't know how I really pulled that off.</p>

            <p>I feel uncomfortable in my tall body. 6 feet and 7 inches of pure nothing. I can't play basketball. I have always wished I could shrink down
            to a more normal size. Even if I could lose just 3 or 4 inches I'd be happy. I feel I stick out and yet all I have ever wanted in my life 
            is to fit in. This dream seems farfetched at this point. When I dream, I always look up. The people around me, in my biggest fantasies, are all 
            taller than me. I don't know what that means, but it is probably not good.</p>

            <p>I'm too hateful of a person. I turn my nose up at anyone who is different. I don't mean this in regards to race or sex or gender, just 
            people fucking piss me off. I hate people who are truly unique. I can't tell if I am unique or not. Are there 1,000,000 people who fit the
            same archetype as me? I don't doubt there are, but what is that archetype? I clash heads with people too similar to me, so I fear meeting
            someone truly similar to me is impossible.</p>

            <p> I'll go back to the doctor soon to talk more. I hope when I die flowers bloom from my grave. I hope I am not buried alone. Thats all
            we really have.</p>

            
            <h3>March 2, 2025</h3>

<p>First Ever Anything</p>
            
            <p>This is the first thing to ever be posted on my website. It's like Twitter
                but only I can post on it. I'm only going to upload to it when I am hammered. 
                Eventually I'll figure out how to put a big picture of Bill Cosby at the top
                of the screen or something I don't know.</p>

            <p> I feel like I am in a really transitional stage of my life, but I also think
                I've thought the same thing every year for the past 7 years. I'm 20 now and I can't win 
            a game of Fortnite for some reason. I haven't won a single game since I turned 20. I only ever play
            cross-eyed drunk so that could have something to do with it</p>

            <p> Getting broken up with is the same feeling for me as when I had no friends as a kid. For some reason I
            mostly hung around retards whenever I went through periods of having no friends. Everybody talks about their friends
            Like they have known them for their whole life, but I've met all of my best friends over the past 4 or so years.
            It's not even like I got bullied, I don't know what it was. Everybody got bullied. A kid would shove you to the ground
            at recess and tell a girl you had a crush on her, then invite you to his birthday party 20 minutes later. I think the worst part 
            of it was I had no safe haven. Nobody at school was on my side, and so was nobody at home. Not like I was abused, I was just 
            the youngest. I remember my parents being so shocked when I would get in trouble for bullying kids, I don't know how they
            didn't realize where this issue may have stemmed from. These are the same people who pumped me with 70mg of Adderall at age 12.</p>

            <p> I got sort of side tracked. But it's like when I was a kid I had nobody to talk to my feelings or really anything about.
            Nobody in my family was my age, the ones who were I didn't see enough. All things considered I'm pretty lucky I didn't turn into some
            incel-twitter-fag. Whenever a relationship ends it feels like nobody is around who gets you anymore. When I get low, which seems to be
            the norm now, I don't have anybody to just rant to it about. I'd call my mom, but then she gets worried I'll off myself. I know I could still
            probably call ex-girlfriend and talk to her, and she'd still probably listen, but I can't put myself through that. How do you remind yourself
            that this person made the decision they don't want you anymore? I'm not still in love with her, I don't think she is with me, but I seethe
            with jealousy at the thought of her with other people. I have no right.</p>

            <p> Hopefully I'll get a new script soon and be able to focus better. I can barely get work done now. I'm basically a functioning alcoholic. 
            I'm having money problems. I never knew of money problems growing up. This is my first time really experiencing this. I feel guilty mentioning
            things related to my families money infront of friends at school, but it's hard to convince yourself that your family has money after growing up
            around what I did. </p>

            <p> I have not had a single stress free moment in probably 3 weeks, since I had my last panic attack. Something really changed in me that night.
            I worry that was more of a psychotic break than it was a panic attack. Time will tell. This is the worst I've felt in a long time. I dont even 
            really want to ski.</p>
